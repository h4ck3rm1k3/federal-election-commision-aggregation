    Re: Independent Expenditure  Dear Mr. Ebinger,  This is in response to your letter
    of April 10, 2003, concerning two independent expenditures filed as part of the
    September 2002 Monthly Report (08/01/02-08/31/02).    Please know that due to
    a clerical error, these independent expenditures were mistakenly categorized and
    reported to the FEC as hard money contributions.  This clerical error has since
    been corrected and our reports are being amended.    An additional $500 independent
    expenditure that was reported in the 12 Day Pre-General FEC Report is directly
    linked to the above independent expenditure, and was incorrectly reported as well.
    \ Please note that the appropriate report will be amended and an additional memo

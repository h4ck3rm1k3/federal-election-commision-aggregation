- input: '"TEXT","F3A",,"To Whom It May Concern.   This is in response to the Commissions
    inquiry about an accounting discrepancy in the Campaign Committee July quarterly
    disclosure filing.  This is an explanatory note attached to the Committee July
    Amended Report and made a part thereof.  The accounting discrepancy resulted from
    two factors.  First is that the election management software packaged employed
    by the Committee does not automatically insert the beginning cash balance figure
    from the ending cash balance figure in the earlier report filed but rather has
    to be inserted manually and will use the prior report beginning cash on hand figure
    as a default.  This is precisely what happened in the April Quarterly Report which
    caused a substantial discrepancy which in turn caused a subsequent accounting
    error in the later original July Report.   Another error involved was that the
    original July report inadvertently used the wrong accounting period for the report.  It
    should have figured activity through June 30 but instead made calculations using
    the July 15 date.  Since the Committee does not employ an accountant it did not
    reconcile the original July Report with earlier reports.  This Amended July Report
    is an accurate accounting and is reconciled with earlier reports of the Committee.    Respectfully
    submitted by the Hurley for Congress Committee."'

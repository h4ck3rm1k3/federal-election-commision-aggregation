    Election Commission (FEC) dated 09/25/02 relative to the Amended February 2002
    Monthly Report (01/01/02-01/31/02) received by the FEC on 06/28/02. Please note
    that the fundraising activities reflected on Schedule H4 for Event 1 and Event
    2 correspond to the fundraising events reflected on Schedule H2. Due to a software
    error Schedule H4 was printing an internal software code (Event 1 and Event 2)
    rather than the full event description that correctly appeared on Schedule H2.
    Our software vendor has fixed the problem and Schedule H2 and Schedule H4 now
    have proper corresponding entries. An amendment is being filed electronically
    in conjunction with this response. We hope this information sufficiently answers
    the questions raised regarding the February 2002 Monthly Report. Please advise
    as soon as possible if any further action on our part is necessary. Sincerely
    John J. McConnell Jr."
